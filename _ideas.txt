Simple rendering app.
Enter a recursive formula and have the program create either a program or image/video.
Image would generate in a large `while` loop
Program would run video.
Video would iterate like such:

unsigned int step;
float val;
std::function inc();

step() {
	step++;
	inc(val);
}

//plot val as function of step

. Pass a function to the parser
. Simple CLI, e.g. `program "x_{n+1}+2"`
	. -v to export video
	. -i to export image
	. -x to *not* preview in executable.

More features:
	. Set floating point precision.
