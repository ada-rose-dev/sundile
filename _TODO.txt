TODO

Continue OpenGL tutorial.
If desired, do SHADERS extra credit at bottom of tutorial.
Current lesson: TEXTURES

Things to do, not covered in tutorial:
Load vertices from file. (Probably covered in Model Loading)
Figure out why I'm getting linear instead of neareset texture interpolation.
Integrate pixel art scaling shader.
